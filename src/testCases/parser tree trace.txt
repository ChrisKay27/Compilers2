1:int x;
	
    1:(INT,null)
	Entering program
	Entering declaration
	Entering nonvoidSpecifier
	match INT

	1:(ID,0) => "x"
	Leaving nonvoidSpecifier
	match ID

	1:(SEMI,null)
	Entering varDecTail
	match SEMI
	
Notice: 
	This is just a possible parser tree trace that could be generated. Neither the trace structure nor the content of the trace is the only result.
	The content vary due to different non-terminal methods you build.

	Example:
		1:int x;
		
			1:(INT,null)
			Entering program
			Entering declaration
			Entering nonvoidSpecifier
			match INT

			1:(ID,0) => "x"
			Leaving nonvoidSpecifier
			match ID

			1:(SEMI,null)
			Entering DecTail
			Entering varDecTail
			match SEMI
			
			the 1:(SEMI,null) trace is different. But they both could be right depends on your method.
